### DEVELOPMENT PROCESS
**Architecture** - Fundamental structural organization for software systems
**Design Patterns** - Solves reoccurring problems in software construction

## 1] Architecture (What & Where)
- The project will need 1 page: Map
- Upload (in the form of geojson) a plots
- Draw a building in the center of the plot
- Customize the properties of the building (floor area, number of floors and height per floor) with a Slider
- Display the statistics of the building
- Deploy to Vercel

## 2] Design Pattern (What & How)
- MapBox for map system
- Deck.gl for 3D building layer
- MUI for UI elements
- Atomic design system for component development
- Jest for unit testing
- ESLint recommended rules
- Precommit hooks for linting and code formatting validation
- Prevent commit if linting not passed
- CI/CD pipeline with Github Actions for running tests
- Seperate logic and view with the help of React Hooks

### GETTING STARTED (FOR THE ONES WHO CLONE THE PROJECT)
First, run the development server:

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
